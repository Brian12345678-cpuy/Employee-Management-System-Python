# Employee Management System in Python

## Project Overview

This project is a modern Employee Management System built using Python and CustomTkinter, with an SQLite3 database backend. It allows for efficient management of employee data, including adding, editing, and deleting employee records. We did this project as our Group Project showing how our software would be used as a disaster management application.
